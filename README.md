## Description

I wanted to create my first portfolio which will be added to later.
I wanted to continue with my learning of basic HTML and CSS, particularly CSS: using flexbox, adding images, creating desired layouts, etc.
I wanted to reinforce good habits of commenting out, and frequent commits.
I wanted to practise further the process of pushing work to github.
I wanted to deploy my finished product and check it had no errors.
I wanted to practise writing an appropriate README.md.
I wanted to learn to use and apply a media query so that the page remains functional on different devices.
